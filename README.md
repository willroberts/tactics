# tactics

A 2D tactics game, similar to Tactics Ogre.

## to do

- finish writing unit business logic (use Occupier)
- write a simple game to test the new grid package
- finish the tmx library and connect it with the grid package
  - load textures from tmx
- test opengl bindings (github.com/go-gl/gl)

## running tests

The commands `make test`, `make test_graphics`, and `make coverage` must be
executed from a package directory, rather than from the repo root.
