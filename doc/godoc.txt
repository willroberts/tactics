    Cell is a container at a specific position inside a Grid.

type Grid interface {
    Width() int
    Height() int

    CellWidth() int
    CellHeight() int

    Cells() [][]Cell
    Cell(x, y int) Cell

    Checkerboard(color1, color2 uint32)
}
    Grid is a two-dimensional array containing a game board which can be
    represented orthogonally or isometrically.

func NewGrid(width, height, cellWidth, cellHeight int) Grid
    NewGrid initializes and returns a Grid. `width` and `height` specify the
    dimensions of the grid itself. `cellWidth` and `cellHeight` specify the
    dimensions of cells within the grid.

type Occupier interface {
    CanOccupy() bool
}
    Occupier is the common interface among anything which can occupy a cell
    within a grid. To place objects in a cell, have your objects satisfy
    this interface.
